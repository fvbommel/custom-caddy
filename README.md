# Custom Caddy build

[![Docker Build and Publish](https://github.com/fvbommel/custom-caddy/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fvbommel/custom-caddy/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yaml)

This repository is used for my custom build of [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com),
containing the plugins I use.
